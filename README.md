## Documentation

This is a desktop version of the Classic Arcade Game.

Clone the repo from here: (https://github.com/jdelia/udacity-frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)

To play the game, visit the [demo](https://jdelia.github.io/udacity-frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) page.

## Instructions

To play the game, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player, up, down, left and right. The goal is to reach the water without colliding with any of the bugs moving across the screen. Each time you play the game, the speed is randomly generated a bit to make it a little more fun.

The player has three lives (chances) to make it across. Good luck!
