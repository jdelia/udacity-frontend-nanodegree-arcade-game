## Instructions

To play the game, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player, up, down, left and right.

_The goal is to reach the water without colliding with any of the bugs moving across the screen._

If you collide, the player is reset back to the starting position.

The player has three lives (chances) to make it across.

Each time you play the game, the speed is randomly generated a bit to make it a little more fun.

Good luck!
